# Music Management System

The code is in the Music Management System -> src

I developed this project purely with Oops concepts in Java and its fundamentals.

The primary goal of this project was to mkeme comfortable with Java as I was 
just figuring things out in it.

The other goal was to improvise my Music Playlist Manager which I made using C.

In this project, we take add songs and can edit song info aswell. We have features
to sort the songs as per the song name, artists, or even playlists.

Overall, a fun project to build.
